# AutoServerShutdown  
Why let your server run 24/7 when no one is playing?
I created this simple plugin to shut down my server automatically, so I'll save some money on my next power bill.
This plugin can be used in combination with Task Scheduler make your server completely automatic!
# Commands:
**/shutdown** *hour* *minute* (Time is in 24 hour format) </br>
example: /shutdown 15 30</br>
**/shutdown time** (Shows how long until the server shuts down)
# Want to help?
You could by helping me port this plugin to Folia. Let's get in touch and start working!
